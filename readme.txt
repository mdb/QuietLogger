Baskerville is Quiet Logger's primary typeface. For systems on which Baskerville is not installed,
the typography will render as Times, Times New Roman, or a generic serif font. 

Quiet Logger does not support widgets.

The design does not account for the use of avatars.
In the Wordpress administration, navigate to Settings > Discussion,
tick "Don't show avatars," and "Save changes" to turn off the use of avatars.
